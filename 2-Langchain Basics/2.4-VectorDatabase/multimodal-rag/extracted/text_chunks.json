Where it is not considered probable that the tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, adidas reflects the effects of the uncertainty by using one of the following methods, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty: \u2500 the single most likely amount or \u2500 the expected value based on the sum of the probability-weighted amounts. In assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable profits (tax losses), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and tax rates, adidas assumes that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and will have full knowledge of all relevant information when making those examinations. \u25ba SEE NOTE 34 Share-based payment The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees is determined by the fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.

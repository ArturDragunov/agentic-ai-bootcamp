    "This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.\n",

    "- Splitting is not strict. If you specify 1000 as a chunk size, splitter WILL TRY to keep the chunks within the size BUT the split is based on the list of splitting characters"
